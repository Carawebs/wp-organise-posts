## User Guidelines
### Select Post Types
Select the post types that you'd like to enable drag-and-drop sorting for by making the appropriate selection in the "Main Settings" tab.

When you access the edit screen for the relevant post type, you'll be able to drag and drop posts into the order that you'd like them to display on the front end of the site.

###  Project Categories
Projects are grouped by project category, and this plugin allows you to create a custom post order for the overall "Projects" display as well as individual project categories.

To set the order of projects on the "Projects" page, drag and drop projects on the projects editing page (e.g. http://yoursite/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=project, accessed by clicking "Projects" in the dashboard). Be careful not to click on any links when trying to drag and drop projects/people, or you'll inadvertently just trigger the link.

### Project Category Order
If you click on a project category link (in the "Project Category" column on the Projects editing page referenced above), you will have access to a collection of projects that have that Project Category.

Dragging and dropping in this page will set the project order for that project category only.

For example if you have a project that is in the "Commercial" and "Transport" project categories, you could set the order in which the project is displayed on each individual project category page - just drag and drop into position on the relevant editing screen. You might have a project display first in "Transport", fifth in "Commercial" and tenth on the main project page.
