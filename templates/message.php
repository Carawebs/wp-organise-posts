<h3 id="select-post-types">Select Post Types</h3>
<p>Select the post types that you&#39;d like to enable drag-and-drop sorting for by making the appropriate selection in the &quot;Main Settings&quot; tab.</p>
<p>When you access the edit screen for the relevant post type, you&#39;ll be able to drag and drop posts into the order that you&#39;d like them to display on the front end of the site.</p>
<h3 id="project-categories">Project Categories</h3>
<p>Projects are grouped by project category, and this plugin allows you to create a custom post order for the overall &quot;Projects&quot; display as well as individual project categories.</p>
<p>To set the order of projects on the &quot;Projects&quot; page, drag and drop projects on the projects editing page (e.g. <a href="http://yoursite/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=project">http://yoursite/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=project</a>, accessed by clicking &quot;Projects&quot; in the dashboard). Be careful not to click on any links when trying to drag and drop projects/people, or you&#39;ll inadvertently just trigger the link.</p>
<h3 id="project-category-order">Project Category Order</h3>
<p>If you click on a project category link (in the &quot;Project Category&quot; column on the Projects editing page referenced above), you will have access to a collection of projects that have that Project Category.</p>
<p>Dragging and dropping in this page will set the project order for that project category only.</p>
<p>For example if you have a project that is in the &quot;Commercial&quot; and &quot;Transport&quot; project categories, you could set the order in which the project is displayed on each individual project category page - just drag and drop into position on the relevant editing screen. You might have a project display first in &quot;Transport&quot;, fifth in &quot;Commercial&quot; and tenth on the main project page.</p></div>
